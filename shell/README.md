# Shell implementation

## Interaction

Start the game with `./game.sh`.
Execute all tests via `./test.sh`.

## Data Structure in field.sh

This time I tried out a different sorted data structure.
The rows are saved from top to bottom. This way printing of the field via `field.sh:print_field` is very easy. If I would have saved the rows bottom to top and some implementation would have been easier.
